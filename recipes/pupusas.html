    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pupusas are a traditional Salvadoran dish consisting of thick, handmade corn tortillas stuffed with a variety of fillings. Common fillings include cheese, refried beans, pork (often called "chicharrón"), and loroco, a type of edible flower bud native to Central America. Pupusas are typically served with a side of curtido, a tangy cabbage slaw, and a mild tomato sauce. The dish is a staple in El Salvadoran cuisine and is enjoyed by many people across Central America and beyond for its comforting and satisfying flavors.

        Making pupusas involves a few steps that require some practice to perfect. The dough, made from masa harina (corn flour) and water, is shaped into small discs that are then filled with the desired ingredients. The filled dough is carefully sealed and flattened before being cooked on a hot griddle until golden and slightly crispy on the outside. This cooking process gives pupusas their characteristic soft and chewy texture, with a deliciously warm and melty center.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups masa harina (corn flour)</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup refried beans (optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheese (queso fresco or mozzarella)</li>

            <strong>Prepare the dough:<strong>
            In a large mixing bowl, combine masa harina and salt. Gradually add water, mixing with your hands until a soft, pliable dough forms. The dough should not be too sticky or too dry; adjust with more water or masa harina as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Divide the dough:</strong>
            Divide the dough into 8 equal portions and roll each portion into a ball.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Fill the pupusas:</strong>
            Take one dough ball and flatten it slightly in the palm of your hand. Add about a tablespoon of your desired filling (beans, cheese, pork) into the center. Carefully fold the edges of the dough over the filling and pinch to seal, then gently flatten the filled dough ball into a disc about 1/4-inch thick. Repeat with the remaining dough balls and fillings.

            <strong>Cook the pupusas:</strong>
            Heat a lightly oiled griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each pupusa for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and slightly crispy. Be careful not to overcrowd the skillet; cook in batches if necessary.

            <strong>Serve:</strong>
            Serve the pupusas hot, accompanied by curtido and a mild tomato sauce. Enjoy!
